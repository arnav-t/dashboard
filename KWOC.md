# Why, hello there!

Welcome to KWoC '17. A lot has already been said and written about why participating in KWoC is already a great step in your path to Open Source Development. In this document, I'll try to list below everything I plan to cover **with your help** as part of KWoC '17.

## Project scope
The goal of this project would be to build a lightweight pluggable dashboard that can easily integrate any number of projects from [MetaKGP](https://github.com/metakgp/) in a modular way. Needless to say, this means that the project is going to involve quite a bit of front-end development and a bit of working with databases.

## Technical know-how
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is quite a natural fit for our requirements, so you'll be writing a lot of Javascript (specifically ES6) and learn about user authorisation & authentication, (nested) components, managing state, routing and communicating with backend APIs.

It is okay if you're unfamiliar with React, but prior coding experience in a high level language like Javascript or C++ would be preferable. I shall be giving access to some great tutorials as well to get you up to speed faster.

## Roadmap for KWoC
- Create the base UI
- Setting up user schema for user authentication
- User authentication (custom + social)
- Integrating MFQP, MCMP, Naarad, GYFT
- Routing

## About me
I am Naresh, 5th year dual degree student, department of Computer Science, IITKGP. Most of my work has been in Javascript, Python and C++ and would be glad to guide you wherever needed, hoping you'll put in just as much effort.

## Still interested?
Great! Reach out to me through email (ghostwriternr@gmail.com) or via Slack (https://slack.metakgp.org/). I try to reply as soon as possible.

Happy coding!
