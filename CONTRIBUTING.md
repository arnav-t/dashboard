## Reporting a bug

Bugs description should include:

* How to reproduce the bug;
* Easy to understand title;

Would be nice to have some code showing how to reproduce the code, you may use [gist](https://gist.github.com) or [Codepen](https://codepen.io) for uploading your example code.

## Requesting a feature

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/dashboard/issues) to request a new feature.

## Commit messages

There are seven simple rules for a great git commit message.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
If the subject isn't sufficient to explain the intent of the commit, then use a body.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
