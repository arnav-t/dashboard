# Dashboard

## Purpose
The dashboard would serve as the central access point for several projects under MetaKGP. The goal is to provide the KGP community an easy to use dashboard with useful utilities meant for students.

## Development instructions
- Use yarn (not npm) exclusively for managing packages. You can install yarn from here: https://yarnpkg.com/en/
- This project has been bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To start the server, use `yarn start`.

## History
The dashboard was originally worked upon for the Inter-IIT tech event sharing the same moniker. KGP won bronze at the event and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/dashboard-beta).

However, a rewrite was needed due to the extremely dirty style of code, all written in under 3 days. Contributing to the original repository could be a real nightmare for the uninitiated (and the initiated as well).

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome. Your contributions could either be creating new features, fixing bugs or improving documentation and examples. Find more detailed information in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/dashboard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## KWoC?
If you reached here through KWoC '17, you're already doing great by doing your research before selecting your project. Please do have a look at [KWOC.md](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/dashboard/blob/master/KWOC.md) to find out more about me, the programme and plans for KWoC.
